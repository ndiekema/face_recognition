# Facial Recognition System Using CNN
## Overview
For this project, a partner and I designed and implemented a facial recognition software. For the sake of comparison, we decided to design and implement two competing architectures, each utilizing a different loss method for the neural network. The cross-entropy and triplet loss methods were compared for performance and scalability. The triplet loss method was chosen due to it's flexibility in adjusting to larger datasets and popularity in industry.
